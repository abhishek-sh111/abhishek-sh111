Overview:
As a senior software engineer with 5+ years of hands-on experience in full-stack development, I specialize in building robust backend architectures with NestJS and frontend UIs with React. I’ve developed rule engines for medical scheduling, built enterprise micro frontends, and prepared systems for AI/ML integration. Whether you’re looking to build intelligent systems or scalable enterprise-grade apps, I’m here to help.

Key Services:

Full-stack web development (NestJS + React)

Backend rule engine and scheduling systems

AI/ML-ready system architecture

Event-driven microservices (Kafka)

UI development using Tailwind CSS, AntD, Material UI

Portfolio Projects:

Member Care System – Admin tool for managing enterprise organizations (React + Node)

Health Scheduling Service – Therapy call platform with rule engine (NestJS + Kafka)

ADOPS Portal – Media ad orchestration platform with React + Docker


Lead development of a robust backend system for intelligent medical scheduling using NestJS, PostgreSQL, and a custom rule engine to manage therapy and coaching workflows.

Integrated secure APIs for data flow between patient data sources and real-time scheduling modules.

Collaborated closely with data teams to prep backend systems for future AI/ML integration for mortality prediction, patient triaging, and call optimization.

Streamlined event-driven architecture using Kafka for real-time alerts and event handling.
